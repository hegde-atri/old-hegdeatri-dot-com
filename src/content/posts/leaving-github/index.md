# why ðŸ¥²

I am currently on the process of leaving GitHub. It hasn't been a good experience for me.

It started when they started ignoring users privacy. They are quite "transparent" but I do not trust it with my private repositories anymore...

There's also the fact that GitHub is propreitary.

## GitLab

GitLab is the best alternative feature-wise. It has all I want and more...except its UI. Its not terrible, it definitely is easy to use but it doesn't have the modern sleek look that I am looking for.

## Codeberg

Its a non-profit association based in Berlin, Germany and hosts Codeberg.org, which is a soft-fork of Gitea. It is mostly limited to Gitea's features. I will be missing out on GitLab's identity and its integrations with some of the tools I already use in CI/CD.


I really like its simplicity and UI compared to GitLab, which feels clunky.


# Conclusion

I will still be using GitHub from some of my projects where it is the most convenient/necessary.

However for the rest of it I will be moving it to Codeberg, and for projects that require GitLab, I will mirror the repo on Codeberg into GitLab.

What are your thoughts? Did I miss any good git platforms?
